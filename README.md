# Decoding-Surface-Code-with-Minimum-Weight-Perfect-Matching
This notebook is a mini-survey on surface codes, a leading framework for topological quantum error-correction. It provides an explanation of decoding surface codes through the minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm. 

## Content
The notebook explores: 

- Basics of Surface Codes
  
  Planar surface codes
  Syndrome extractions
  Measure qubits

- Decoding Surface Codes

  Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM)
  MWPM decoder of surface codes
  Syndrome subgraphs
  Decoding process: setting error paths on the surface codes
  MWPM algorithms and their complexities

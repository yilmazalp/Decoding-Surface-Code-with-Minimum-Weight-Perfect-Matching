    "# Decoding Surface Codes with Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching\n",

    "In this mini-survey, we review the fundamentals of surface codes, a leading framework for quantum error correction known for their high threshold error rates, local stabilizer measurements, and scalability. We then introduce the minimum-weight perfect matching decoder, a graph-theoretic technique widely used for decoding surface codes. The central aim is to explain how decoding can be framed as a matching problem. "

    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "An ideal quantum computation is represented by a circuit, consisting of wires, which represent qubits, and the gates or quantum operations denoted by squares or rectangles. These circuits may work perfectly in theory, but in practice, so many errors may occur. Noises and errors have the potential to abandon the computation, which results in a useless output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Early quantum computing experiments in the 1990s suffered from high error rates, often exceeding $10â€“20\\%$ per gate. Now, the error rates are recorded as around $0.5-1\\%$, nevertheless, it is still too high to execute deep quantum algorithms reliably. Quantum computations can quickly become corrupted and yield meaningless results without mechanisms to detect and correct these errors. This motivates the development of quantum error correction (QEC), which is a foundational framework that allows us to protect quantum information and enable fault-tolerant quantum computation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Error correction in quantum devices is much more challenging than correction in classical coding theory for three reasons. Repetition of a quantum state is not possible due to $\\textit{no-cloning theorem}$. In quantum coding theory, we encounter $\\textit{phase-flip errors}$ in addition to $\\textit{bit-flip errors}$, making the quantum devices have many different possible errors. Measurement on the whole quantum states leads to collapsing the states, thus we lose quantum information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The surface codes are a family of quantum error correction codes defined on $2D$-lattices of qubits. They encode a logical qubit into the joint entangled state of a $d \\times d$ square of physical qubits. One of their key strengths lies in the locality of their stabilizer measurements. All interactions involve only neighboring qubits, making them well-suited to current quantum hardware with limited connectivity. The logical information is stored nonlocally across the lattice, which provides protection against local physical errors. This structure allows for the detection and correction of errors through repeated local syndrome measurements. Surface codes are also known for their high threshold error rates (around $1\\%$). It means that they can tolerate relatively high levels of physical noise before logical errors become unmanageable. Therefore, we can say that they are the leading candidates for scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation."

    "### Stabilizer Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of $n$-fold Pauli operators, say $\\mathcal{P}_{n}=\\{\\pm I, \\pm X, \\pm Y, \\pm Z\\}$, forms a group, which is denoted as $\\mathcal{G}_{n}$. A $\\textit{stabilizer code}$ is defined by a set of commuting $n-k=r$ Pauli operators $S_{1}, ...,S_{r}$, called $\\textit{stabilizer}$, which generates a subgroup $\\mathcal{S}$ of $\\mathcal{G}_n$. The code space $\\mathcal{T(S)}$ is defined as the set of all quantum states $\\ket{\\psi}$ that are $\\{+1\\}$ eigenstates of every stabilizers: \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\mathcal{T(S)} = \\{\\ket{\\psi} \\in \\mathcal{H}^{\\bigotimes n}_{2} | S_{i}\\ket{\\psi} = \\ket{\\psi}, \\forall S_{i} \\in \\mathcal{S} \\}\n",
    "\\end{align} where $\\mathcal{H}$ denotes the $\\textit{Hilbert space}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Stabilizers are operators that we need to perform special measurements to help detect errors without collapsing the quantum state and losing quantum information. In order to obtain information about errors, we perform measurements of the stabilizers through $\\textit{measurement qubits}$ (or we can say anqilla qubit), so that the information of the quantum state $\\ket{\\psi}$ is not lost. The classical information we have obtained through the measurements of stabilizers is called $\\textit{syndrome}$ of the error, which is denoted by $s$. They tell us whether an error has occurred nearby, but not where the error occurred exactly. We think of syndromes as footprints. The error syndrome $s$ is defined as a binary vector of length $n-k$, $s \\in \\mathbb{F}^{n-k}_{2}$ where $n-k$ is the number of stabilizers, and $\\mathbb{F}$ is any field. Given a set of stabilizers, $\\{S_{1}, \\dots, S_{n-k}\\} \\in \\mathcal{S}$, a Pauli error $E$, and any initial state $\\ket{\\psi}$, we have the relation as follows;\n",

    "                    &= (\\pm E) \\ket{\\psi}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Through this equation, we can say that the $i$-th element of the syndrome, $s_{i}$, gives the information about the communication relationship between the stabilizer $S_{i}$ and the error $E$: \n",

    "    E S_{i} = (-1)^{s_{i}} S_{i} E\n",
    "\\end{equation*}  A stabilizer code is denoted as $[[n, k, d]]$. This notation says that an $[[n, k, d]]$ code encodes $k$ logical qubits into the $n$ physical qubits with the minimum distance $d$, which is the minimum weight of an undetectable error, which is a non-trivial error whose syndrome is trivial. More precisely, undetectable errors are logical operators that non-trivially change the encoded information, keeping it within the code space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each logical qubit is identified by a pair of $X$ and $Z$ stabilizers. For the $j$-th logical qubit acting on the $n$ physical qubits, one satisfies that \\begin{align*}\n",

    "## Basics of Surface Codes \n",
    "\n",
    "A $\\textit{surface code}$ is defined on a two-dimensional lattice. It is composed of $\\textit{physical qubits}$, which are $\\textit{data qubits}$ and $\\textit{measurement qubits}$(also called ancilla qubits). The measurement qubits are responsible for stabilizing the quantum state of the data qubits. In the surface code, there are two types of measurement qubits: measure-$X$ and measure-$Z$, corresponding to stabilizer measurements of the Pauli $X$ and $Z$ operators, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the lattice of the surface code, except for the boundary, each measurement qubit is adjacent to the four data qubits, forming a $\\textit{square plaquette}$. Conversely, each data qubit is adjacent to four measurement qubits such that two measure $X$ and two measure $Z$. On the boundary of a surface code, there is no definite one adjacency pattern. A measurement qubit may be adjacent to three data qubits, while the data qubits may interact with two or three measurement qubits, depending on their positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we consider a surface code, which is denoted as $[[13, 1, 3]]$. This notation indicates that the code uses $13$ data qubits to encode a single ($k=1$) logical qubit. The code has the distance $3$, which gives the minimal number of physical errors required to cause a logical error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical planar surface code, the lattice consists of both data qubits and measurement qubits. Note that the notation $[[n,k,d]]$ gives the number of only data qubits, but we can deduce the number of measurement qubits as well because the relation $n-k=r$ says that there are $r$ measurement qubits in the lattice. In our case, the surface code with $13$ data qubits is placed on a $5 \\times 5$ grid, consisting of $13$ data qubits and $13-1=12$ measurement qubits, in total $25$ physical qubits. Thus, we can illustrate the surface code as follows, \n",

The light purple squares, which are connected to data qubits with blue edges, are measure-$Z$ qubits. Conversely, the measure-$X$ qubits are denoted by dark purple square nodes, which are connected to the neighbouring data qubits via red edges. \n"

    "### Syndrome Extraction \n",
    "\n",
    "Syndrome extraction is a crucial part of quantum error correction with the surface code. It is the process of measuring stabilizers to detect whether an error occurred, without collapsing the encoded logical state. The aim is to infer the syndrome outcomes $(\\pm1)$ by measuring the $X$ and $Z$ stabilizers. The measurement outcome tells us which stabilizers have been violated, which means an error occurred. The outcome $-1$ says that an error has occurred on one or more of the data qubits involved in these violated stabilizers. Performing the measurements for all $X$- and $Z$-type stabilizers, we obtain a syndrome pattern that localizes errors indirectly. It enables correction without losing the logical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We form a quantum circuit consisting of data qubits, measurement qubits, and a sequence of $CNOT$ gates to perform stabilizer measurements. The measurement qubits are initialized in the $\\ket{0}$ state. To extract a $Z$ stabilizer using a measure-$Z$, we apply the four $CNOT$ gates to the four adjacent data qubits as $\\textit{control}$, and the measurement qubit as the $\\textit{target}$. At the end of the process, measurement on the measure-$Z$ qubits gives an eigenstate $Z_{a}Z_{b}Z_{c}Z_{d}$ for the four data points $a, b, c,d$. It means that we obtain the equation \n",

    "\n",
    "An outcome of $-1$ indicates that the stabilizer has been violated, because of the presence of an $X$-error on one of the four data qubits. This follows from the fact that $X$ and $Z$ anticommute with each other, which means $XZ = -ZX$. So, if an $X$-error occurs on the qubits in the $Z$-stabilizer, the stabilizer measurement flips $+1$ to $-1$. The circuit below illustrates this measurement process as follows,  \n",

    "The measurement process on measure-$X$ qubits differs slightly from that of measure-$Z$ qubits. We construct the quantum circuit, beginning with initialization of the measurement qubits in the $\\ket{0}$ state. Then, we apply a Hadamard gate to transform the basis from $Z$ to $X$. Following this, we apply four $CNOT$ gates, where the measure-$X$ qubit is the $\\textit{control}$ while the four neighboring data qubits are the $\\textit{targets}$. After the $CNOT$ gates, we apply the second Hadamard gate to the measurement qubit to come back to the $Z$-basis. Performning a measurement on the $\\ket{0}$, we obtain an equation which gives a piece of information about the syndrome outputs:\n",

    "where $a, b, c, d$ are the four data qubits adjacent to the measure-$X$ qubit. If the state has a $Z$-error on one of the four data qubits, the anticommutation relation $XZ = -ZX$ ensures that the syndrome outcome will be $-1$. It concludes that $Z$-errors can be detected through measure-$X$ qubits. The measurement process can be shown through the circuit below. \n",

    "![title](Images/x-measure-qc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a measure-$X$ qubit cannot detect an $X$-error on the data qubits, because all of the Pauli-$X$ operators commute with each other. As a result, the stabilizer measurement yields the $+1$ outcome even in the presence of such an error. Similarly, a measure-$Z$ cannot detect a $Z$-error on data qubits, as Pauli $Z$-operators also commute with each other. It means that a $Z$-error does not flip the syndrome outcome, and the measurement returns $+1$. In conclusion, because of the anticommute relation $XZ=-ZX$, measure-$X$ qubits detect $Z$-errors, and measure-$Z$ qubits detect $X$-errors. \n"

    "The MWPM decoder is one of the most widely used decoding algorithms for surface codes. The aim is to deduce the most likely error path from the observed syndrome outcomes. We mentioned that errors are detected by measuring stabilizers through measurement qubits in a surface code. However, these errors give information about the error chains in the surface code. It means that we have no knowledge about the data qubits having errors, and that need to be corrected. Through the MWPM decoder, we will find error chains, and reveal the data qubits with errors in the surface code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the surface codes, $\\textit{defects}$ are measurement outcomes of $X$ or $Z$ stabilizers which yield $-1$. They indicate that an error has been detected. To decode the error pattern, we need to construct a graph, which we call $\\textit{syndrome graph}$. We map all of the defects, which are violated stabilizers, to the vertices in this graph. Edges are possible error paths connecting the pair of defects. We set the weights of edges, calculating their lengths, mostly using the Manhattan distance, which is the distance calculated by summing the absolute difference of corresponding Cartesian coordinates. After construction of the syndrome graph, our task is a minimum weight perfect matching problem: finding matchings of all defects such that the total sum of weights is minimised.    \n",

    "Since we have two types of stabilizers and their measurements, we can construct two subgraphs with vertices representing violated $X$ and $Z$ stabilizers, which we call $X$-defects and $Z$-defects, respectively. For the two subgraphs, we construct edges connecting the defects, and set the weights on the edges by calculating the Manhattan distance between two $X$-defects and two $Z$-defects, separately, in the two subgraphs. \n",

Through these pairs, we form possible error chains, which deduce the decoding of our surface code. \n",

    "The most important step in the construction of an MWPM decoder is to find the perfect matching with minimum weight sum, once the subgraphs has been constructed from the syndrome information. One of the most powerful algorithms for this task is $\\textit{Edmonds' blossom algorithm}$, originally proposed by Jack Edmonds. Its worst-case complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(n^{3}log(n))$ for a graph with $n$ vertices. \n",

    "Due to the importance of speed of real-time decoding in fault-tolerant quantum computing, several optimized algorithms of the MWPM decoder have been proposed. Fowler's implementation achieves a constant-time decoding complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ under certain assumptions. Higgot and Gidney proposed a sparse blossom algorithm with an improved complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n^{1.32})$. Fusion blossom algorithm has been introduced by Wu with the complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n)$. Blossom V algorithm, which is introduced by Kolmogorov, is the optimized implementation of Edmonds' blossom algorithm. It is designed for weighted graphs, making it efficient for decoding surfaces with the MWPM decoders. Blossom V achieves a worst-case time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^{2}log(n) + nm)$, where $m$ is the number of edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "Designing faster MWPM algorithms is very challenging, but crucial task. Large code distances may be needed to obtain fault-tolerant quantum computers. Also, decoding schemes must be scalable when the code distance are increase. It follows that we must have the MWPM decoders with low complexity and high speed to handle challenging computational tasks in the surface codes with long code distances."
